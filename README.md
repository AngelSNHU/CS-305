Answer: When looking at my client software security vulnerabilities, I did well in adding enhancements to cover where there were code issues and code errors throughout. Seeing the potential code issues/errors throughout showed me how important not leaving vulnerabilities is. Yet, I also found how important it is to have second looks at your work and make their own necessary adjustments or fixes to one's baseline code. 


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Answer: Creating and running the dependency check was by far the hardest part of the vulnerability assessment. As I had never created one and it required the biggest learning curve to learn how to create them and even open them through java eclipse.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Answer: Having further revisions can continue to enhance security as well as most importantly collaborating with others can be beneficial. In the future I plan to work with others in regards to bigger projects to have multiple eyes and find imperfections and vulnerabilities in code. 


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Answer: Running the dependency check and seeing if new vulnerabilities had arisen was what indicated whether I made any errors in my code.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Answer: Utilizing youtube as a form of guidance for certain assignments was crucial in progressing not in just this assignment but the course as a whole.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Answer: I plan to show my future employers all my completed projects from previous coding courses. It will show my efficiency in different coding languages as well as show my adaptability in different coding project types.
